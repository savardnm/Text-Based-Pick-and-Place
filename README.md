# Description
Modern robot interfaces focus on using code or psuedo-code based implementations of routines and actions. These setups require a knowledge of the control software and how to use it, as well as an understanding of common coding practices. In this project, we propose an alternative control method which uses text-based inputs to control a robot for pick and place tasks.
